# Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for Single-Qubit Hamiltonians

Author: Anna Payne
Date: February 2026

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a complete Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) pipeline in order to find the ground state energy of a single-qubit Hamiltonian. The VQE is a hybrid quantum- classical algorithm in which a quantum device evaluates the expectation value of a parameterized trial state (HWE Ansatz), and a classical optimizer (SPSA) updates those parameters to minimize the energy.

## Key Features

    **Hamiltonian Construction**: Supports any arbitrary Hamiltonian expressed as a sum of Pauli strings $(aI+bZ+cX+dY)$.

    **Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HWE)**: Utilizes an $Ry​(θ)−Rz​(ϕ)$ circuit design, optimized for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware.

    **SPSA Optimization**: Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm is robust against statistical noise (shot noise) present in  quantum measurements.

    **Automated Convergence Tracking**: Callback system to visualize the optimization path toward the exact ground state energy.


## 2. Theoretical Framework
### The Ansatz

The trial wavefunction $∣ψ(θ,ϕ)⟩$ is generated by rotating the initial $∣0⟩$ state.

    $Ry​(θ)$: Rotates the state vector to the desired polar angle.

    $Rz​(ϕ)$: Controls the azimuthal phase

    $∣ψ(θ,ϕ)⟩=Rz​(ϕ)Ry​(θ)∣0⟩=(cos(θ/2)eiϕsin(θ/2)​)$

### Measurement & Expectation Values

The expectation value of the Hamiltonian $H$ is calculated by measuring the indiviual Pauli components:

$⟨H⟩=a+b⟨Z⟩+c⟨X⟩+d⟨Y⟩$


Measurements for $X$ and $Y$ are performed by transforming the state into the Z-basis using Hadamard ($H$) and Phase ($S^†$) gates, prior to measurement.

## 3. Installation & Setup

To ensure reproducibility, a Conda environment file is provided. This pins the environment to Qiskit 1.x to ensure compatibility with the packages qiskit_algorithms and qiskit_aer.


### Prerequisites

    Anaconda or Miniconda

### Environment Configuration

    Create the environment:
    
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate qiskit_vqe_env
    jupyter notebook vqe_explanation.ipynb
    ```

## 5. Results & Discussion

This VQE implementation achieves convergence to the exact ground state energy within a tolerance of 10−3 using 8192 shots/measurement. The use of SPSA demonstrates significant resilience to noise within the quantum energy landscape caused by finite sampling, outperforming standard gradient-based methods in a (simulated) noisy environment.

## 6. Future Work

* Expansion to multi- qubit systems (such as H2​ molecule).

* Implementation of the Error Mitigation techniques (Readout Error Mitigation).

* Execution on real IBM Quantum hardware via the qiskit-ibm-runtime.
